# Adience_age_classification
The project purpose is to enhance age classification accuracy on Adience benchmark.

It was the issue of my Master thesis, which I can sum up into finding ways to enhance the accuracy of age estimation/classification from a single still image algorithms. The chosen dataset is the challending and in the wild Adience benchmark.

The final system is a convolutional neural network, CNN, based on the well known VGG16 and finetuned on Adience benchmark. Other methods of accuracy improvement was also deployed in the final model. The accuracy was improved by a margin of 5%.
